- What part of the design did you get stuck on? What took the most time? Similarly, what was the easiest part? 
      I got a bit stuck on the dashboard components (Totals, Site Visits, Revenue) because I couldn't find anything from the Material library that was close enough to the original design. So I ended up making custom components instead to make sure it looked as similar as possible. This took the most time because I had to figure out how to best incorporate my custom styles into the pre-built Material components. The easiest part was finding the Material icons to use for the drawer buttons.

- What part of the design didn't make sense? Did you change anything?
      The design made sense to me. I tried to keep everything as exact as I could. 

- If you had more time, what would you have liked to implement? 
      I would have liked to have made the hover state on the drawer buttons more accurate looking. I would have also liekd to have added more exact responsive breakpoints, but instead settled on using flexbox properties so the dashboard would at least be fairly responsive. I would have also liked to have added real chart or graph components inside the dashboard. 

- What did you have to research or lookup while working on this? 
      This was actually my first time ever using the React and Material libraries. I considered coding it from scratch or usign Bootstrap, but I wanted the end-result to look as accurate as possible by using the pre-made components from Material. I essentially had to learn React from the ground up. I watched a series of great tutorials by Wes Bos on React, and I read as much Material documentation as I could. I set up my file structure using Create React App, and basically started teaching myself to think in terms of components.
